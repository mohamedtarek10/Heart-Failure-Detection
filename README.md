## Introduction

Heart failure is a serious condition that affects millions of people worldwide. Early detection and diagnosis are crucial for effective treatment and management. This project aims to build a machine learning model using Support Vector Machines (SVM) to predict heart failure based on clinical data.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the **Heart Failure Prediction** dataset, which contains various clinical features related to heart health. The features include:

- Age
- Anaemia
- High Blood Pressure
- Creatinine Phosphokinase
- Diabetes
- Ejection Fraction
- Platelets
- Serum Creatinine
- Serum Sodium
- Sex
- Smoking
- Time
- Death Event

## Dependencies

To run the notebook, you need the following libraries:

- Python 3.9
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

You can install the required dependencies using the following command:

pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn

## Results 

The notebook includes steps for training and evaluating the SVM model. The evaluation metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, and the confusion matrix. Here is a summary of the results:
##
Accuracy: 0.89
Precision: 0.85
Recall: 0.86
